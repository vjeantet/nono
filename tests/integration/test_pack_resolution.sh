# Pack-store profile resolver tests
#
# Hand-installs the synthetic test pack from tests/fixtures/synthetic-pack
# into the local pack store, then verifies:
#
#   - `--profile <install_as>` resolves through the pack-store branch of
#     load_profile (the same branch the pull/migration flow uses).
#   - Sandbox enforcement honours the same pack-shipped profile contents.
#   - Cleanup removes the pack-store entry without leaving lockfile state.
#
# Why hand-install rather than `nono pull`: pull goes through Sigstore
# verification against a real registry. Mocking that for integration
# tests is more machinery than the resolver test warrants. The pull /
# verification / wiring pipeline is covered by:
#   - wiring.rs unit tests (15+ cases)
#   - migration.rs unit tests
#   - end-to-end smoke tests in nono-packs CI
#
# This suite is specifically about: when a pack IS installed, does
# `--profile <name>` find it through the user-facing CLI. Real execution
# verifies pack lockfile and Sigstore metadata, so enforcement below uses
# the exact fixture profile file by path rather than treating the
# hand-installed fixture as a trusted registry install.
