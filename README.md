> [!NOTE]
> In the lead-up to a 1.0 release, APIs are stabilizing. API changes may still occur where necessary, but will be kept to a minimum.

**Run AI agents in a zero latency sandbox in seconds and with zero setup** — *Claude Code, Codex, Pi, CoPilot, Hermes, OpenCode, OpenClaw* and more — nono gets you up and running within seconds, with no daemon, no container, no VM, and no disk space usage. Out of the box, nono enforces a least-privilege sandbox and supports macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

From here **fork the config**, tweak it, theme it, make it your own, and share it with your team or the community via the [nono registry](https://registry.nono.sh).

**Want to operationalise and run at scale or within your team?** Engineers at some of the largest tech companies in the world use nono as part of their workflows or to run AI agents in production.

**Copied by many** — nono pioneered the zero-latency, zero-setup agent sandbox, and continues to innovate and lead the way in agent sandboxing.

---

## Quickstart

#### curl

```bash
curl -fsSL https://nono.sh/install.sh | sh
```

#### macOS / Linux (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install nono
```

**Other platforms** — Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, RHEL, openSUSE, WSL2, and Nix: [see install instructions](https://nono.sh/docs/cli/getting_started/installation).

## Run it!

Search for an agent in the registry, then run it:

```bash
$ nono search opencode
always-further/opencode	-	Official Opencode Plugin

$ nono run --profile always-further/opencode -- opencode
```

That's it. `opencode` now runs with read/write access to the current directory and **nothing else** — your SSH keys, your cloud credentials, the rest of your disk are invisible to it.

Profiles for all the popular agents live at [registry.nono.sh](https://registry.nono.sh), secured and ready to pull. Each one bundles the right filesystem scope, network allowlist, hooks, skills and more.

## Make it your own!

Outgrow the defaults? Scaffold a profile and tweak it — same command you already know:

```bash
nono profile init opencode --extends always-further/opencode
nono run --profile opencode -- opencode
```

Are you an agent developer and want to publish your own agent package? We would love to have you and promote your work! [See the docs](https://nono.sh/docs/cli/features/package-publishing).

## Ready to go deep?

Head over to the [docs](https://nono.sh/docs) and discover nono's rich composable policy system, credentials injection, L7 filtering, supply chain security, rollback, multiplexing, audit and more.

## Library support

nono provides FFI bindings for Rust, Python, TypeScript, and Go.

Also available as [Python](https://github.com/nolabs-ai/nono-py), [TypeScript](https://github.com/nolabs-ai/nono-ts), and [Go](https://github.com/nolabs-ai/nono-go) bindings.
